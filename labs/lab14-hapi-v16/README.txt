lab 14: makemehapi

For this lab, complete as many exercises from the self-guided 'makemehapi'
exercises, as time allows.

You can find makemehapi at https://github.com/hapijs/makemehapi

As of this writing, these exercises are written for hapi v16, and they won't
work on hapi v17. To do these exercises, you'll need to install hapi v16 and
required modules need to be previous versions so that they'll work with
hapi v16.

The package.json file in this directory includes the correct dependencies.

The best course of action is to ignore any instructions to install modules
in the makemehapi program and just do an npm install from inside this
directory before you get started with makemehapi.
